    I enjoy creating small tools and games, whether it's to solve everyday computer annoyances or to explore random ideas.
    There's something really satisfying about slowly building up a project into something genuinely useful, all while picking up new things about the language along the way.

    While my drawing skills are questionable at best, I still have a lot of fun making simple 2D pixel art of characters and things I like as well as small 3D models & effects.
    Just… maybe don’t stare too long at the perspective ^^"

    Even if the list down bellow only shows the movies I truly love, my best moment probably is describing how much I hate Avatar 2.

- head: I love games

    For me, the perfect mix is bouncing between competitive, grindy games and strange little indie gems. That balance keeps things fun.
    Also, please play *The Stanley Parable*, it's an experience everyone should have.
